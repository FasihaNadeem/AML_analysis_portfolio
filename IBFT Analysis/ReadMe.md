# Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of Inter Bank Funds Transfer (IBFT) transactions from an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) perspective. The primary purpose of this project is to develop a practical understanding of how IBFT transactions are monitored, analyzed, and assessed for potential financial crime risks using rule-based logic and Excel formulas.

Through this project, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of transaction monitoring concepts such as high-value transactions, transaction frequency, unusual behavioral patterns, and risk-based prioritization. The project simulates a real-world fintech or digital wallet environment where AML analysts are required to review alerts and identify suspicious activities efficiently.

For this analysis, a 100-row dummy dataset was created to represent a realistic IBFT transaction scenario. The dataset includes a mix of normal and suspicious transactions, allowing meaningful analysis and identification of red flags.

### Key Findings

The IBFT transaction analysis identified that most transactions were low risk and aligned with normal customer behavior. However, a specific sender account exhibited repeated high-value transactions with a very high frequency, triggering multiple red flags including fraud indicators and unusual patterns. These transactions were classified as high risk and would require escalation for enhanced due diligence and potential STR/SAR consideration.
