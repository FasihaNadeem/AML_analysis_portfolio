## Project Overview

This project is focused on KYC analysis using a dataset of 100 customers. The main goal was to identify unusual behaviors, inconsistencies, and potential risks in customer information. The analysis was performed in Excel, using advanced formulas, conditional formatting, and pivot tables to clean and validate data, check for missing or duplicate information, and ensure accuracy of key fields like CNIC, Date of Birth, Age, and Monthly Income. Special attention was given to identifying mismatches, such as occupations that did not align with reported salaries and duplicate identification numbers. The project concluded by flagging high-risk customers who require further verification or enhanced due diligence, providing actionable insights for compliance and risk management.
## Step 1: Data Cleaning & Validation

In this step, the dataset was cleaned and validated to ensure accuracy and consistency. The original dataset contained columns such as`CustomerID, Full Name, Age, Date of Birth, Address, Nationality, Occupation, Phone_Number, Monthly_Income (PKR), and Identification_Number.`   Each column was checked and formatted correctly. Duplicate entries in CustomerID were verified to ensure uniqueness, while any duplicates in Phone_Number and Identification_Number were highlighted using conditional formatting for further review. This process helped to identify inconsistencies and potential red flags, preparing the data for detailed KYC analysis.
## Step 2: Red Flags & Inconsistencies Identification

In this step, helper columns were created to identify red flags and inconsistencies in the customer data. The columns included `Verification, CNIC Validation, Age Verification, Nationality Validation, Duplicate_Phone, and Duplicate_ID.` Each column used formulas and conditional formatting to flag issues such as invalid CNIC or Passport formats, nationality discrepancies, and duplicate phone numbers or identification numbers. This helped in quickly spotting potential risks and preparing the dataset for further KYC analysis.
## Step 3: KYC Red Flag & Status Assignment

In this step, two columns, KYC Red Flag and Status, were created to manually define potential issues for each customer and assign their risk status. Most customers had missing identity information, which was marked as Manual Verification required in the Status column. Four customers were identified as high-risk based on inconsistencies and unusual behaviors, and they were highlighted for further investigation. This step ensured that all potential risks were clearly documented and prioritized for review.
## Step 4: Prepare Report

In this step, a summary report was prepared highlighting key findings from the KYC analysis. Four customers were identified whose reported monthly income did not align with their occupation, indicating potential inconsistencies. The report included all relevant customer details, flagged issues, and recommended next steps for further verification and risk mitigation. Suggested actions included requesting supporting documents, performing enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers, and updating KYC records to ensure compliance.

## Learning Outcomes from This Project

Through this project, I learned how to perform practical KYC analysis using real-world data. I understood how `data cleaning, validation, and duplicate checks` improve the accuracy of customer information. I also learned how to create `helper columns` to identify red flags, such as `incorrect age, invalid CNIC formats, nationality mismatches, and repeated phone numbers or IDs.` This project improved my analytical thinking and helped me understand how unusual patterns—like income not matching occupation—can indicate potential risk. Finally, I learned how to prepare a clear KYC summary report and highlight high-risk customers for further investigation.
